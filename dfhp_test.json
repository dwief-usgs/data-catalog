High value subwatersheds were identified using an analysis that incorporated native trout distributions, abundance, and genetics (bull trout Salvelinus confluentus; redband trout Oncorhynchus mykiss; and Yellowstone cutthroat trout O. clarkii, including fine-spotted form); known occurrences and modeled potential distributions of native non-game fishes; drainage network connectivity (disconnected at large dams); and land protection status. The watershed rankings can be used in aquatic conservation planning applications that are watershed-based and have a focus on both native trout and non-game fishes. Two scenarios are presented here: a ranking in wihich existing protected areas (GAP Class 1, 2 lands managed for biodiversity) are included in the optimization, and a ranking which does not consider protected areas. Example applications are identifying important areas for watershed restoration efforts, or implementing additional land management or protection efforts to facilitate natural watershed function to meet fish life history needs.
